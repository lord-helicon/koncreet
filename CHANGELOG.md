# Changelog

## Unreleased

- doctor: the admin-user check now matches `ssh apply` (keys **and** sudo); the SSH check finds `00-koncreet.conf` (flags legacy `99-koncreet.conf`) and verifies effective settings with `sshd -T`; warns about root-only koncreet config and prints the `chmod` fix; never prompts for a sudo password when run as non-root
- baseline: creating a user ran `umask 077` in the main shell, so every file written later in the same run (sysctl, journald, logrotate, fail2ban and apt config) was root-only and new directories were `700`; non-root tools such as command-not-found then warned about unreadable apt config. The umask is now limited to the password file, and koncreet always runs with `umask 022`
- dry-run: no longer asks the fail2ban whitelist question (shown as a `PLAN:` line instead), no longer prints the "Before you disconnect" checklist, and ends with "Dry-run done - nothing changed"
- log: dry-run as root logs to `/var/log/koncreet.log` (tagged `dry-run`) instead of `/opt/koncreet/koncreet.log`, which `install.sh` and `uninstall` delete; non-root runs log to `~/.local/state/koncreet/`

## 0.3.0

First release of the [lord-helicon/koncreet](https://github.com/lord-helicon/koncreet) fork of [jimididit/koncreet](https://github.com/jimididit/koncreet).

- ssh: drop-in renamed to `00-koncreet.conf` so it wins over `50-cloud-init.conf` (sshd keeps the first value); `ssh apply` verifies effective settings with `sshd -T` and rolls back on override; `ssh status` shows effective values. Legacy `99-koncreet.conf` is migrated.
- ssh: hardening gate now requires the key user to have sudo, and asks you to confirm a koncreet-generated sudo password was saved before root login is disabled
- fail2ban: detect your SSH client IP under `sudo` (walks parent process environment, then `who -m`); warn when it can't; `whitelist` validates the IP
- firewall: parse Ubuntu 24.04 `ListenStream=0.0.0.0:22` as port 22 (was 0, which made `ufw allow` fail)
- Error/warning/info messages (including every `die`) were silently dropped from the terminal; they now print
- apply: SSH hardening is decided once before the run, so a plan that says "SKIP SSH harden" no longer hardens SSH after `baseline` creates the user in the same run
- CI: `tests/integration.sh` runs lockout scenarios against a real sshd, sudo and ufw rule parser on Debian 12/13 and Ubuntu 22.04/24.04
- Installer and README point at `lord-helicon/koncreet` (`KONCREET_REPO` still overrides)

## 0.2.3

- fail2ban: tolerate unset SSH_CONNECTION under `set -u` (CI dry-run / non-SSH shells)

## 0.2.2

- CI: ShellCheck fails on errors only (sourced CFG_* vars trip SC2034 across files)

## 0.2.1

- Mark `koncreet` / `install.sh` executable in git; run version tests via `bash` for CI

## 0.2.0

- `koncreet doctor` - apply-readiness checks
- Post-apply checklist after `apply` / Run everything
- Baseline: `--pubkey` / `--pubkey-file`, `baseline undo`, logrotate + MOTD
- Firewall: custom `N/tcp` / `N/udp` and `firewall_ports=` config
- `koncreet uninstall [--purge]`
- Menu “Run everything” only plans SSH harden when a key user exists
- PR CI (tests + shellcheck) and container smoke dry-run
- Release workflow runs tests before publishing

## 0.1.0

- First tagged toolkit: baseline, firewall, fail2ban, updates, ssh
- curl install to `/opt/koncreet` + PATH symlink
- Compact terminal UI, config apply, self-install
